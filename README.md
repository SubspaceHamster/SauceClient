# SauceClient
## What is it?
SauceClient is an experimental testing Minecraft client whose purpose was mainly to familiarize myself with applicational Java.
Currently it's a somewhat ghost client, featuring both normal PvP client features alongside additional "utility" modifications.
The code for the ClickGui is not mine, found it decompiled and discovered that it belongs to HeroCode.
Inspired by the lack of availability of AceClient :skull:

## Will this have updates?
Depends on if I truly require them, as this client was purely made to satisfy my "needs."
Major Bugs will be patched, report in issues if found (obviously).

## Things to get done:
- Finish up the normal PvP client features (23%)
- Add more hacks (57%)
- Documentation (1%)
- Optimization (38%)

*Notes*
- Little to no documentation
- Not very optimized
- Probably not the best client out there ðŸ˜°
